</h4> <div class="para">Now we will introduce the idea of a system of differential equations. A system of ODEs (hence IVPs) involves multiple dependent variables whose rate of change depend on one-another. Such situations arise all the time. For instance, the variables could be competing animal species, interacting sub-populations during an epidemic (those who are susceptible, infected, and recovered), or the position and velocity of a mass on a spring.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">A particularly simple example is given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
x' = -y,\amp\ \ x(0) = 1\\
y' = x,\amp\ \ y(0) = 0.
\end{align*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">In this example we are using <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> as the dependent variables to describe the coordinates of a particle moving in the <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span>-plane. The values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> describe the particle’s position, whereas the values of <span class="process-math">\(x'\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y'\)</span> decribe where it is moving (instantaneously). More specifically, let’s think about the motion of the particle decriped by the differential equations when it is in each of the four quadrants of the plane.</div>
<ul class="disc" id="Circle_as_System-4-8">
<li><div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> is in the first quadrant, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are both positive. Looking at the equations, we see that this means <span class="process-math">\(x'\)</span> is negative and <span class="process-math">\(y'\)</span> is positive. Thus, the particle is moving up and to the left.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> is in the second quadrant, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is negative and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is positive. Looking at the equations, we see that this means <span class="process-math">\(x'\)</span> is negative and <span class="process-math">\(y'\)</span> is also negative. Thus, the particle is moving down and to the left.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> is in the third quadrant, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are both negative. Looking at the equations, we see that this means <span class="process-math">\(x'\)</span> is positive and <span class="process-math">\(y'\)</span> is negative. Thus, the particle is moving down and to the right.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Finally, if <span class="process-math">\((x,y)\)</span> is in the fourth quadrant, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is positive and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is negative. Looking at the equations, we see that this means <span class="process-math">\(x'\)</span> is positive and <span class="process-math">\(y'\)</span> positive. Thus, the particle is moving up and to the right.</div></li>
</ul>
</div> <div class="para">The motion described above sounds like it might be circular (or at least periodic). Indeed, the solution to the given system of IVPs is <span class="process-math">\(x(t) = \cos(t)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y(t) = \sin(t)\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> changes, the particle traces out the unit circle. Varying the initial conditions will change the starting point, which will change the radius if the starting point is not one unit from the origin.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="Sec1_1_Insights_and_ODEs.html#Circle_as_System">in-context</a></span>
