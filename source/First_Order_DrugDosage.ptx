  <p>
	In this worksheet we consider the problem of administering a drug under the following conditions: 
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>
		<p>
			The minimum amount of drug in the bloodstream to be effective is <m>2</m>mg. On the other hand, the maximum amount to avoid adverse effects is <m>4</m>mg. Thus, over the 24 hour dosing period, the amount in the blood must remain between <m>2</m>mg and <m>4</m>mg.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			The drug is removed from the bloodstream and moved into other tissues (where it is effective) at a rate proportional to the amount present in the bloodstream per hour. The half-life of the drug in the body is <m>4.5</m> hours.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			Due to staffing patterns, a nurse will only administer an injection or change an IV bag at intervals that are an integer number of hours, e.g. every hour on the hour.
		</p>
	</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
	We wish to model and compare the following two dosing protocols:
  </p>
  <ol>
	<li>
		<p>
			<term>Continuous Drip:</term> Under this protocol the drug is administered several times in amounts of <m>a</m> mg at a constant rate over some fixed time period. For instance, every two hours the nurse might attach a new IV bag that continuously administers <m>8</m>mg over the course of <m>30</m> minutes.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>
			<term>Bolus Injections:</term> The drug may be administered as a <em>bolus</em>. That is, a certain amount of drug is injected all at once (essentially instantaneously). For instance, the nurse may inject <m>3</m>mg exactly every two hours.
		</p>
	</li>
  </ol>

	In order to model these protocols, you may find the following Insightmaker functions useful for your flow rates:
