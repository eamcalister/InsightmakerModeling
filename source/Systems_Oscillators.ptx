  <introduction>
	<p>
		Second-order ODEs are ones of the form
		<me>
			x'' = f(x,x',t)
		</me>
	To handle these equations numerically, we must convert such ODEs to a system of first-order ODEs. We do this by introducting the variable <m>v = x'</m>. We use the letter <m>v</m> because we are now thinking of <m>x</m> as a position and <m>x'</m> as a velocity. This yields the system of first order ODEs
	<md>
		<mrow>v' = \amp\ f(x,v,t) </mrow>
		<mrow>x' = \amp\ v </mrow>.
	</md>
	The basic Insightmaker diagram for a second order equation becomes the following:
	<figure xml:id="second_order_idiom">
		<caption>The general second order equation diagram.</caption>
		<image source="images/second_order_idiom.png" width = "75%">
		</image>
	</figure>
	This construction can be generalized to any higher-order equation by introducing more intermediate stocks for the derivatives. 
	</p> 
	<p>
		We will now explore an important class of examples inwhich it makes sense to break the single flow into <m>v</m> into multiple branches.

		<statement>
			<p>
				A <term>simple harmonic oscillator</term> is a spring-mass system in which the magnitude of the restoring force of the spring is proportional to the dispalcement of the mass. Given the mass <m>m</m> and spring constant <m>k</m>, the position <m>x</m> of the mass satisfies the second-order ODE
				<me>
					mx'' = -kx
				</me>
				or equivalently
				<me>
					mx''+kx = 0.
				</me>
				A <term>damped harmonic oscillator</term> has an additional damping term, where the damping is assumed to be proportional to the velocity. Using <m>\gamma</m> as the damping coefficient, we have
				<me>
					mx''+\gamma x' + kx = 0.
				</me>
				A <term>forced harmonic oscillator</term> introduces an external force function <m>F(t)</m> and we have
				<me>
					mx'' + \gamma x' + kx = F(t).
				</me>
			</p>
			Note that in spring-mass systems we have <m>m</m>, <m>k</m>, and <m>\gamma</m> positive.

		We now explore the behavior of oscillators in various cases with Insightmaker.
