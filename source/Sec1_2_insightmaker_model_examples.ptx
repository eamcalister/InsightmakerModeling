<example><title>Malthusian (Exponential) Growth</title>
	<p>
	Here we will consider the example given by <xref ref="Exp_as_IVP"/>, but add some context so that we can use more of the features of Insightmaker. Here is the set up for the problem: <em> A population of creatures is initially <m>10</m> and grows exponentially. If the population is <m>20</m> after three weeks, what will the population be in one year?</em>
	</p>
	<solution><title>Calculus Class Version</title>
	<p>
	First we will give the standard formulation and solution using Calculus. The problem may be reformulated as the IVP
	<me>
		P' = kP, P(0) = 10,
	</me>
	where <m>P</m> represents the number of creatures, the independent variable is <m>t = </m> time in weeks, and <m>k</m> is the continuous percent growth rate in units of <m>\frac{1}{\text{weeks}}</m>. We can then observe (by whatever technique you prefer) that the general solution is given by 
	<me>
		P(t) = 10e^{kt}.
	</me>
	Using the data point <m>P(3) = 20</m>, we find <m>k = \frac{\ln(2)}{3}\approx 0.23</m>. Thus, <m>P(52) \approx 10e^{0.23\cdot 52} \approx 165,140</m> creatures. <alert>However, this solution isn't the point of this text!</alert> We are only including it to reference the result. 
	</p>
	</solution>
	<solution><title>Using Insightmaker</title>
	<p>
	The Insight that we will use to solve this problem is below

		Two features we will use in this solution are having sliders linked and using the tabular output option. To show the output of the simulation as a table instead of the graph of a function, use the configuration button in the simulation window and choose "table" as indicated in the image to the right.

		<p>
		Upon scrolling through the table with <m>k=0.1</m>, we find <m>P(3) \approx 13.5</m>. Thus, <m>k</m> is too small.

		Adjusting the slider for <m>k</m> until we have <m>P(3)\approx 20</m>, we see the correct value of <m>k</m> is about <m>0.23</m>. If we adjust the step size in the slider below <m>0.01</m>, we can opbtain a more accurate value.

<example><title>Simulation Algorithm Setting Exploration</title>
	<p>
		In this example we will explore the simulation algorithm and step size settings in the context of the exponential growth model.
	</p>
</example>

<example><title>The Circular Functions as Solutions to a System</title>
	<p>
		Here we will explore the system of ODEs introduced in <xref ref="Circle_as_System"/> to show the scatter plot (phase plane) display setting and revisit the choice of display algorithm.
	</p>
</example>



<example><title>Ant Tunneling</title>
	<p>
		We can approach the problem of ant tunneling by considering two stocks: the dirt in the tunnel and the dirt removed.
