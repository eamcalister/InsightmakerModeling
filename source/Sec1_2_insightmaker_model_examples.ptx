<example><title>Malthusian (Exponential) Growth</title>
	<p>
	Here we will consider the example given by <xref ref="Exp_as_IVP"/>, but add some context so that we can use more of the features of Insightmaker. Here is the set up for the problem: <em> A population of creatures is initially <m>10</m> and grows exponentially. If the population is <m>20</m> after three weeks, what will the population be in one year?</em>
	</p>
	<solution><title>Calculus Class Version</title>
	<p>
	First we will give the standard formulation and solution using Calculus. The problem may be reformulated as the IVP
	<me>
		P' = kP, P(0) = 10,
	</me>
	where <m>P</m> represents the number of creatures, the independent variable is <m>t = </m> time in weeks, and <m>k</m> is the continuous percent growth rate in units of <m>\frac{1}{\text{weeks}}</m>. We can then observe (by whatever technique you prefer) that the general solution is given by 
	<me>
		P(t) = 10e^{kt}.
	</me>
	Using the data point <m>P(3) = 20</m>, we find <m>k = \frac{\ln(2)}{3}\approx 0.23</m>. Thus, <m>P(52) \approx 10e^{0.23\cdot 52} \approx 165,140</m> creatures. <alert>However, this solution isn't the point of this text!</alert> We are only including it to reference the result.

  <example><title>Ant Tunneling</title>
	<p>
		We can approach the problem of ant tunneling by considering two stocks: the dirt in the tunnel and the dirt removed.
