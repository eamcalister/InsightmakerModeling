  <title>Higher Order Equations and Systems</title>
  
<introduction>
  Both systems of differential equations and second order ODEs (ODEs involving second derivatives) have made an appearance previously in this text. Systems appeared in <xref ref="Circle_as_System"/> and <xref ref="rumor_spread"/>. By the Hill-Keller in <xref ref="SprintModel"/> model as an ODE with position <m>x</m>, it takes the form
  <me>
    mx'' = mF-kmx'.

  In this chapter we will explore several important types of systems and higher-order equations with Insightmaker, making use of its capabilities when analytic methods fail or make things difficult (such as when the flow rates should depend on a condition being met).
